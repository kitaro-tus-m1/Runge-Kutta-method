# This repository is for assignment4 about Runge-Kutta method.
Numerical calculation to understand the development of density parameters in Lambda-CDM model.

## step1
For single 1st-order ODE with an initial value

## step2
For binary simultaneous 1st-order ODE with two initial values

## step3
For the assignment4 (with a set of boudary conditions)

I have changed two initial values a lot of times to find the answer that satisfies the conditions.

The searching process is all by hand.

I would like to automate it, but I have not yet come up with such a good idea.
